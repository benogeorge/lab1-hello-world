# Hello World

A simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.t

This project is now used as a starting point and reference for students in the AI4SE course to practice using CoPilot for software development. It includes re-usable custom instructions and journal-logger agent configurations as well as guidelines for interacting with CoPilot and logging those interactions in a journal.

The project was also originally created to be used for demonstrating git cloning, editing, and pushing changes to a repository on GitHub, possibly dealing with merge conflicts, and other git-related operations. (Instructions for that exercise are included further down in the README, students can choose to do it at any time as a practice exercise.)

## Students of AI4SE: Instructions 
1. After cloning this repository, check your remote URL using `git remote -v` to ensure you have the correct access to the repository.
2. Configure your git username and email if you haven't already, using `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email ". Verify your configuration using `git config --global --list`.
3. Update this README file: Add your name and a brief message in the ## Students Comments section below.
4. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
5. Wait for me to tell you when to push your changes to GitHub. Once you have the go-ahead, push your changes using `git push origin main` (or the appropriate branch name if you're working on a different branch).

## Students Comments - Please add your name and a comment here
#### Format:
####  - Your Name: Your message here.

Example:
  - John Doe: Hello, I'm excited to learn about git and version control!
  
  - Krishna Bansal : I'am excited to learn more about AI and it use in coding. 



## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Files

- [`main.py`](main.py): Main script that prints the message.


## Custom Instructions & Journal Logger Agent

This repository uses two key configuration files to guide AI and document your work:

- **Custom Instructions**: `.github/instructions/a4se.instructions.md`
  - Defines project-specific rules for Copilot and other AI tools.
  - Ensures responses follow tutor-mode, incremental implementation, and journaling requirements.
  - No installation needed—just keep this file in place. The AI will read and follow it automatically.

- **Journal Logger Agent**: `.github/agents/journal-logger.agent.md`
  - Enforces logging of every Copilot interaction in `JOURNAL.md` (reverse-chronological order, required format).
  - No manual installation: this agent is automatically loaded if present in the repo.
  - To use: Just interact with Copilot as usual. After each prompt, a new entry is prepended to `JOURNAL.md`.
  - If you find out your JOURNAL.md is not updating, you may trigger an update at any by asking CoPilot to "update the JOURNAL.md with the latest interactions". You may also ask CoPilot to "read again the instructions in .github/instructions/ai4se.instructions.md and the journal-logger agent instructions in .github/agents/journal-logger.agent.md to make sure it is following them and updating the JOURNAL.md after every interaction".

**How to update or customize:**
- To change project rules, edit `.github/instructions/ai4se.instructions.md`.
- To change logging format or user identity, edit `.github/agents/journal-logger.agent.md`.

**Reference:**
- See both files for detailed instructions and examples.

## How to Reuse for New Projects

You can easily reuse the custom instructions and journal-logger agent in any new project:

1. **Copy the files:**
  - `.github/instructions/ai4se.instructions.md`
  - `.github/agents/journal-logger.agent.md`
  - (Optional) Add a fresh `JOURNAL.md` to your new repo root.
2. **Update as needed:**
  - Edit the instructions file to match your new project's rules or style.
  - Update the user identity or logging format in the agent file if required.
3. **That's it!**
  - No installation or extra setup is needed. Copilot and compatible AI tools will automatically use these files if present.
  - All prompt interactions will be logged in `JOURNAL.md` in the new project.

**Tip:**
- Keep your `.github` folder structure the same for best results.


---
## Journal Logging Convention

- Every Copilot interaction should be logged in `JOURNAL.md`.
- New entries must be prepended (most recent first).
- Use timestamp format: `MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM`.
- Include: Prompt, Changes Made, Reasons for Changes, and Context.

### Entry Template

```md
**New Interaction**
**Date**: MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM
**User**: denis.amselem@gmail.com
**Prompt**: <user prompt>
**CoPilot Mode**: Agent
**CoPilot Model**: GPT-5.3-Codex
**Changes Made**: <summary>
**Reasons for Changes**: <why>
**Context**: <relevant notes>
**My Observations**: 
```

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Files

- [`main.py`](main.py): Main script that prints the message.

# Git / GitHub Conflict Exercise Instructions
### This was an exercise to demonstrate git cloning, editing, and pushing changes to a repository on GitHub, possibly dealing with merge conflicts, and other git-related operations.
#### It was meant to be done during the first 2 weeks of the course, but it can be done at any time as a practice exercise.

1. After cloning this repository, check your remote URL using `git remote -v` to ensure you have the correct access to the repository.
2. Configure your git username and email if you haven't already, using `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email ". Verify your configuration using `git config --global --list`.
3. Update this README file: Add your name and a brief message in the ## Students Comments section below.
4. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
5. Wait for me to tell you when to push your changes to GitHub. Once you have the go-ahead, push your changes using `git push origin main` (or the appropriate branch name if you're working on a different branch).

## Students Comments - Please add your name and a comment here
